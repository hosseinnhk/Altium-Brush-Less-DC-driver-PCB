# Altium Brushless DC (BLDC) Driver PCB

This repository contains the Altium Designer files for a **Brushless DC (BLDC) Motor Driver PCB**, designed for control of BLDC motors in various applications.

## Overview

Brushless DC motors are widely used in modern applications due to their high efficiency, reliability, and compact size. 

### Key Features
- **Three-Phase BLDC Motor Control**: Supports standard three-phase BLDC motors.  
- **PWM Control**: Precise speed and torque regulation using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM).
- **Isolated Signal Drivers**: Ensures safe and reliable operation by electrically isolating the control signals from the power stage.  
- **Current Protection**: Integrated overcurrent protection to safeguard the motor and driver circuitry.  
- **Compact Design**: Space-efficient layout suitable for embedded systems and compact devices.  

### Applications
- Drones and UAVs.  
- Electric vehicles (small to medium scale).  
- Industrial automation systems.  
- Robotics and servo systems.  
- Home appliances (e.g., fans, pumps).  

## Repository Contents

The repository includes:  
- **Schematic files**: Full circuit design for the BLDC driver.  
- **PCB layout**: Optimized PCB design for manufacturing.  
- **Component libraries**: Custom and standard components used in the design.
